## Introduction

First, let’s look at the picture.  The economic losses caused by cybercrime have increased rapidly in recent years. Digital technology has connected us in incredible ways, yet it has also opened doors to new, sophisticated forms of crime. 

So, how should we prevent cybercrime, and what exactly are cybercrimes?

## Types of cybercrimes

Let’s take a look at some of the most common types:

**1. Internet Fraud**
These are online scams that aim to steal money or personal information, such as fake shopping sites and investment scams.

**2. Hacking**
Unauthorized access to systems or data, leading to data theft or breaches.

**3. Phishing**
Tricking people into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites.

**4. Ransomware**
Malicious software that locks files and demands payment to restore access.

In short, cybercrime is about stealing your money, personal information, and data.

## Impact of cybercrime

Cybercrime can have a huge impact, including direct financial losses, psychological distress after being phished or hacked, and a loss of trust between companies and customers due to data breaches.

## Protect ourselves

So how can we protect ourselves from cybercrime?

**Be cautious of phishing**: Avoid clicking on unfamiliar links, and verify requests for money transfers directly with the person.

And create strong, unique passwords.

Regularly update your devices and applications to protect against the latest security threats.

Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities, or use a VPN to keep your data secure.
