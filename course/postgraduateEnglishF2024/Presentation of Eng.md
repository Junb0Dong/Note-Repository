So, what exactly are cybercrimes? These are criminal activities that are carried out using computers or the internet. They range from hacking, phishing, identity theft, and financial fraud to ransomware attacks.

### types of cybercrimes

Let’s look at some of the most common types:

**1. Internet Fraud**
Online scams aiming to steal money or personal information, like fake shopping sites and investment scams.

**2. Hacking**
Unauthorized access to systems or data, leading to data theft or breaches.

**3. Phishing**
Tricking people into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites.

**4. Ransomware**
Malicious software that locks files and demands payment to restore access.

### Impact of Cybercrimes

Cybercrimes have widespread and severe impacts, affecting individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. Let's look at some of the key consequences:

1. **Financial Losses:**
   The most immediate impact of cybercrime is financial loss. In recent years, as shown in reports, these losses have reached staggering levels. For example, in 2023 alone, cybercrime caused losses of over $12.5 billion globally. These financial impacts are felt across sectors, from individuals losing savings in online scams to corporations paying millions in ransomware attacks.
2. **Emotional and Psychological Impact:**
   Victims of cybercrime often face emotional distress. For individuals, being a victim of identity theft or losing money in a scam can lead to stress, anxiety, and even depression. Many people feel violated and powerless, as their personal information is exploited. Businesses, too, experience pressure as they deal with public scrutiny and internal strain from managing a crisis.
3. **Loss of Trust:**
   Cybercrimes, especially those involving data breaches, damage trust. When a company is hacked, customer information like addresses, credit card numbers, and even health records can be exposed. Customers may lose trust in the company’s ability to protect their data, leading to a loss of business.

### protect yourself

why cybercrimes? **your money your money your money**

So, how can we protect ourselves? Here are some practical tips:

1. **Be Aware of Phishing:** Always verify the sender’s information before clicking on links or downloading attachments. Most legitimate companies won’t ask for sensitive information through email.
2. **Strong Passwords:** Use complex passwords and consider a password manager. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites.
3. **Update Software Regularly:** Many cyberattacks exploit weaknesses in outdated software. By updating our software, we protect ourselves from known vulnerabilities.
4. **Use Secure Wi-Fi Networks:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for transactions or accessing sensitive information. If you must use it, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
