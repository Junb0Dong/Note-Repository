  \section{Think about the following questions. Give your opinions.}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [(1)] Personality is not permanent. The earlier studies and Scottish study indicate that personality can change over time.
    \item [(2)]I agree. The negative personalities still live after we accept them. Accepting them will improve our emotions, but they still influence my life. For instance, I have procrastinated and will be affected by it and do something late, though I have accepted it. Of course, I will have a good attitude towards it. But nothing changed in my life. When I accept and change it, I will change and do something on time. It improves my life very significantly.  
  \end{itemize}
